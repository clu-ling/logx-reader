# Annotations

The rules defined in the `logx-reader` grammars are run over annotated text, which is generated by a `processor` and stored in JSON. An example JSON for the text "How many TEUs of Frozen Meat are heading to Hamburg?" can be found in [this Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/zwellington/21688441b3d8a62f8e2f2051e1792a63).

## Processors

Currently there are three processors avalaible to the REST API: `logx`, `CluProcessor`, and `ProxiedProcessor`. The `logx` and `CluProcessor` are defined by `CluLab`. The `ProxiedProcessor` can be defined by the user and can be found under `reader/src/main/scala/org/parsertongue/mr/processors`. This allows for custom annotations to be used (ProxiedProcessor is currently defined to use SpaCy).
